He is an exceptional Duelist with a crazy 266.05 average combat score. His best agents are Neon (281.56 ACS), Yoru (272.68 ACS), and Raze(269.99 ACS). ZmjjKK excels at taking the entry fragger role, entering sites aggressively to deal damage per round on the offense. His high 1.16 K/D ratio also shows his great aiming skills. \n \n 2. Controller: ZIHAN "Z1Yan" LIU from JDG ESPORTS. Z1Yan is a versatile Controller who can play Omen (227.41 ACS), Viper (197.97 ACS), KAY/O (230.39 ACS), and the new agent Deadlock (230.29 ACS). With a 224.25 ACS and 1.14 K/D ratio, he is proficient at using smokes and abilities to block vision and set up his team for executes. His 0.39 assists per round demonstrates his team play. \n \n 3. Sentinel: Ilia "vo0kashu" Ushakov from DRAGON RANGER GAMING. vo0kashu is an experienced Sentinel with a 254.1 ACS. His main agents are Cypher (265.91 ACS) and Killjoy (210.24 ACS), but he can also play Omen and Sova if needed. With a 1.17 K/D ratio and 0.31 assists per round, he excels at locking down sites with his ultility and trading frags. His stats show he is a well-rounded player who can perform on both offense (220.36 ACS) and defense (253.66 ACS). \n \n 4. Initiator: LIFAN "Viva" RAN from JDG ESPORTS. Viva is a skilled Initiator with a 230.62 ACS. He is best on Gekko (262.47 ACS) and Sova (228.92 ACS), using his recon and flashes to gather information and create space for his team. His 1.41 K/D ratio is extremely impressive for an Initiator. While he has a lower 0.31 assists per round, his 180.43 average damage per round on offense shows his fragging ability. \n \n 5. Flex: Zhao "Smoggy" Zhang from EDWARD Gaming. As the flex player and likely in-game leader, Smoggy has an incredibly deep agent pool spanning Controllers like Omen, Clove, and Brimstone, Initiator like KAY/O and Breach, and Duelists like Jett. He also has experience on 9 different maps. Smoggy\'s game sense and versability will be crucial for this team.',
