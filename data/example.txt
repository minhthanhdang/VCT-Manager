A typical rush A attack round would start with Youhao use Brimstone to drop smokes to cover some vision. Gustavo and Yushin on Fade and Sova release Haunt and Shockbolt to blind enemies and clear corners. In the mean time, Kim lay down traps with Cypher to prevent flanks, then rejoin the team to enter the site. Erick Santos will be the entry fragger with Jett, enter the site quickly with tailwind, drop cloudburst smokes, and totally confuse the enemies. He might die first, but with his skill, he can at least take down 1 defenders, weaken the defend lineup for the rest of the team to barge in and claim the site.
