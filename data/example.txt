Here is an example of an excellent multi-regional team of 5 Valorant vct-international players:

  1. Duelist: Yongkang "ZmjjKK" Zheng - EDWARD Gaming (VCT China). He has a crazy average combat score of 266.05 playing Duelists like Neon, Raze, Jett, and Yoru. He always take the entry fragger role in his team, entering site and dealing as much damage and confusion as possible. And he does his job exceptionally well with 0.23 first kill rate and an average of 160 damage per round on offense side.

  2. Controller: Sean "bang" Bezerra (100 Thieves - VCT Americas). He has only played 2 agents in 2024: Omen and Viper, with a total of 56 games, showing his professional in this role. He has a staggering 214.92 ACS, 1.10 K/D ratio, 138 damage per round, 0.33 assists per round, and he has experience playing 9 different maps. He proves to be the best controller, as he can place strategic smokes to block vision, allowing himself and his teammates to re-position to a better angle.

  3. Sentinel: Benjamin "benjyfishy" Fish is pro player from Team Heretics, currently playing in VCT EMEA region. His main agents are Sentinels Killjoy and Cypher, with a total 94 games in 2024. He also plays Viper, giving him the flexibility to play maps where Sentinels are not needed. He has a balance performance between offense and defense, with both stats are above average (>190 ACS). On offense side, he can lay traps to cover flank, or using his crown control abilities to zone enemies off site and to protect site from retake. On the defense side, again, his Cypher's traps, smoke, and Killjoy's turret and alarmbot are crucial to detect enemies, locking down the site entrance. He is very experienced and can play well in almost every map currently in rotation.

  4. Initiator: Gustavo Rossi (Nickname Sacy) is a pro player from Sentinels, and he is playing in Valorant Champion Tour Americas. His best initiator is Sova, as he achieves 212.14 average combat score with this agent. On Skye and Fade, he has slightly lower average combat score, but compensates with outstanding assists per round (0.48 and 0.53). His agents pool and playstyle makes him a good fit for the initiator role, taking the responsibility of scouting for enemies locations, releasing blinding abilities to support site entrance, and throwing crown-control abilities.

  5. Flex: SEUNGMIN "ban" OH is a VCT Pacific player from Talon Esports. His agent pools covers 4 different roles: Initiator, Controller, Duelist, and Sentinel, with 13 different agents. With Skye, Killjoy, Cypher, and KAY/O being the most played agents, he has good knowledge about how to set up attacks and defense, and how to play with and against certain agents. Additionally, his experience across 9 different maps further proves that he understands the game more than anyone else. Even with such broad agent and map pool, he still maintains the average of 204.33 combat score, around 137 damage per round, and 0.95 K/D ratio. He deserves the In-game leader title of this team!
